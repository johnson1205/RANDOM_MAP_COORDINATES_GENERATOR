# RANDOM_MAP_COORDINATES_GENERATOR

The project is my very first project(in 2018) since i have a burning curiosity about geography.
I denote that each run will give you five random coordinates and you can copy and paste it on the google map.
The code is accessible to public, you can access and even download it.
Have a fun time.
